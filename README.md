This repository contains my final project for the Introduction to Quantum Computing course, took on a full scholarship at the non-traditional school Qubit by Qubit, an educational initiative of The Coding School, and in partnership with IBM Quantum. It is concerned with using Grover's algorithm to solve the four colour problem, followed by potenetial applications beyond the field of Mathematics.
